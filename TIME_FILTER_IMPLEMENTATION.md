// 30 Days: Daily buckets for last 30 days  
// 1 Year: Monthly buckets for last 12 months
// All Time: Monthly buckets for all bookmark data
```

#### Chart Configuration
- X-axis labels adjust based on time period (Jam/Tanggal/Periode)
- Data aggregation matches the selected time interval
- Chart maintains CSP compliance with disabled animations

### 4. User Experience

## Usage
Users can click any of the four time filter buttons to immediately update the bookmark activity chart to show data for that specific time period. The chart title dynamically updates to reflect the selected timeframe.

## CSP Compliance
All new functionality maintains compatibility with the existing Content Security Policy by using `addEventListener` instead of inline event handlers and following the established CSP-compliant patterns.
