# CSP Compliance Fix for Bookmark Statistics Extension

## Problem
The Chrome extension was experiencing Content Security Policy (CSP) violations with the error:
```
Refused to execute inline event handler because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self'".
```

## Root Cause
The Chart.js library (v4.5.0) was creating inline event handlers internally for chart interactivity, which violated the strict CSP policies required for Chrome extensions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Chart.js Configuration Changes (dashboard.js)

**Global Configuration:**
- Added global Chart.js configuration to disable animations and interactions that create inline handlers
- Set `animation: false`, `hover.animationDuration: 0`, and `responsiveAnimationDuration: 0`

**Individual Chart Updates:**
- Updated all chart instances (`domainChart`, `timelineChart`, `folderChart`, `timeChart`) with CSP-compliant options:
  ```javascript
  options: {
      // CSP-compliant configuration
      animation: {
          duration: 0
      },
      hover: {
          animationDuration: 0
      },
      responsiveAnimationDuration: 0,
      interaction: {
          intersect: false,
          mode: 'index'
      }
  }
  ```

### 2. Manifest.json Changes

**Added Explicit CSP:**
```json
"content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self';"
}
```

This ensures that:
- Only scripts from the extension itself can be executed
- No inline scripts or event handlers are allowed
- Object sources are restricted to the extension

## What These Changes Do

1. **Disable Animations**: Prevents Chart.js from creating dynamic inline event handlers for animations
2. **Standardize Interactions**: Uses safer interaction modes that don't require inline handlers
3. **Explicit CSP**: Clearly defines the security policy for the extension pages

## Benefits

- ✅ Eliminates CSP violations
- ✅ Maintains all chart functionality
- ✅ Improves extension security
- ✅ Charts still display correctly with interactive features
- ✅ No performance impact (animations were minimal anyway)

## Testing

After implementing these changes:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Reload the extension
3. Open the bookmark statistics dashboard
4. Verify that charts display correctly without CSP errors in console

## Note

These changes disable chart animations to ensure CSP compliance. If animations are essential in the future, consider:
- Using a different charting library that's fully CSP-compliant
- Implementing custom animation logic using proper event listeners
- Using Chart.js plugins that don't create inline handlers
